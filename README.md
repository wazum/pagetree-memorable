# pagetree-memorable
Make the TYPO3 page tree remember its last position

# Background

The feature that the page tree memorizes its last position and open page was removed in TYPO3 8 (maybe not intentionally).

# What does it do?

This extension adds a little bit of Javascript to activate the last active page (in page and list module).

Currently only tested with TYPO3 8.7 LTS.

# Installation

Add the github repository in your composer.json and require the package:

    composer require wazum/pagetree-memorable
    
(Currently only available on github)
